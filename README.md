# _*Ascii-Art-Web*_

- Ascii- web is a project that is mainly based on the web-implecation of the _Ascii-art_ project. The project uses Golang to setup and run a server, displaying the generated art-piece to the Web page.

## _*Description*_

- The program uses the 3 banner files from the previous Ascii-art project to display the different '_fonts_' to print out the ascii-art. It uses the  "GET" method for sending responses to the _GUI_ (Grapgical User Interface) and uses the "POST" method for posting request to the server.

## _*Usage*_

- The program web page has a text form to input desired input text that we want to see its Ascii-art implementation regulated by the banner file-fonts, whoch will be provided as well.
- The server is started on the commandline using the commands:

```bash
gor run <name of the file>
```

- Similarly another command could e used disregard of the name of the file;

```bash
go run .
```

- This will run any Go source file found in the directory, in our case we only have one file.
- This will further, start a server and display the port of the localhost that it is running in, for this case we will use `:8080` if we experience any problem in finding the link to the web on the terminal, we are going to type this on a new tab in our web browser `localhost:8080`.
- Since now we have accessed the page, we are going to the icing on the cake :)
- We be presented with a text form to input our text, input a text of your desire and click on the `Generate` button to enable the magical engine to quick-start. Taraa! We got our Art generated on the lower form, in a perfect way. Is it not satisfying ? :)
- I know, it can never be !...

## _*Algorithm*_

- As a developer, or a curious lad, you have probably asked, `how?` I know! I know!, let me take you through it...
- The Ascii art-web is a part of ASCII-ART that uses the skills from front-end development, in the languages: `HTML`, `Java Script` and `CSS`of course let's not forget our backend-cook `Golang`.
- The front-end section, requires a little much tatse to the design world, and the better rendering of a webpage.
- The heavy part you ask? haha!... yeah that's the acsii-art implication.
- The input text is (this will be further defined by the team's leader...)
